Al: Hi there!
- What's going on here?
    Al: Oh, we're just removing all the tech nerds from this planet.
    Ian: Yeah, we don't need any super intelligence popping up here!
    - But we're decades away from realizing full Artificial General Intelligence!
        Al: I know, but Ian isn't convinced.
        Ian: Those Azure data centers are doing something!
        - But they're just mining BitCoin!
            Al: You can probably make more money by just trading!
            Ian: I'm not buying it!
        - But they're just running Bot code for 8-bit adventure games!
            Al: Nice try!
            Ian: Nobody plays adventure games anymore!
        - But, but...
            Guy: I guess I can't convince you.

        Al: Ok, because you asked nicely!
        Ian: NO! The mission isn't completed yet!
    - Pretty please with a cherry on top?
        Al: Ok, because you asked nicely!
        Ian: NO! The mission isn't completed yet!
    - I give up…
        Ian: Great, now I can get back to work!

- Is this an actual spaceship?
    Al: Sure is!
    Al: It's an 8-bit stellar class beam-er-upper™ convertible!
    Ian: Stop divulging top secret information!
- Bye!
    Ian: Don't touch anything!
